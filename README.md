# DSA Recall Mock App

A minimal local app to improve long-term recall of **already-solved LeetCode problems** using quick daily mocks and binary self-evaluation.

---

## Goal

Help engineers preparing for Tier-1 / FAANG interviews to:
- Avoid forgetting previously solved problems
- Practice **active recall** instead of re-solving
- Eliminate planning and tracking overhead

---

## Features

1. Store **only already-solved LeetCode problems**
2. Classify each problem into a **pattern + variant (sub-pattern)**
3. Generate a **mock test of N problems** (user selects N)
4. Display **only the problem name and LeetCode number** during mocks
5. Allow binary evaluation: **Able / Not Able**
6. Track **Not Able** problems internally
7. **Prioritize failed problems** in future mock generation
8. Automatically **shuffle problems** in mocks
9. Work **locally** with no login or account
10. Require **no manual planning or scheduling**

---

## Non-Goals

- No new or unseen problems
- No solution code or editor
- No timers, scores, streaks, or analytics
- No reminders or notifications
- No cloud sync or authentication

---

## Intended Usage Flow

1. Add already-solved problems and classify them
2. Generate a daily mock (e.g., 3–5 problems)
3. Mentally derive solutions
4. Mark each problem as **Able / Not Able**
5. Close the app

Total overhead: **under 2 minutes per day**

## Philosophy

- **Active recall > passive revision**
- **Binary honesty > graded confidence**
- **Minimal UI > feature-heavy tools**
